# google_books_react_mongoose

## See the Deployed app here! https://thawing-cove-16195.herokuapp.com/

**List of core dependencies:**
- React (create-react-app)
- React Router (react-router-dom)
- axios (axios)
- express (express)
- mongoose (mongoose)

This is an assignment/coursework with an objective to create a full MERN stack web application.  The objectives that are accomplished with this web app age:

- Allowing for users to query for books using Google Books API (https://www.googleapis.com/books) using Axios.  
- Displaying returned search results from API on page, and allowing users to "save" books of their choice, or to visit details about the book on the Google API page.  Saved books appear on a separate page (accessed via React Router).
- Saved books are stored into a MongoDB via Mongoose.  Saved books can be deleted from database as well.
